## Notes

The result of this meeting was the formulation of two committees, one to establish a presence on YouTube for remote meetup organizers and a process for accepting remote talks and publishing them. 

Additionally, a committee was formed around vetting and accepting proposals for the foundation to sponsor and gather support for. If you are interested in joining either committee please email sara.chipps@dotnetfoundation.org
