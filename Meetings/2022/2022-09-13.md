## Agenda:

### User Group Committees:
* Jon reported that the initial message to inactive UserGroups was sent last month, and selected groups will be deactivated on September 15th.

### .NET Events - Open Discussion
* **.NET Conf** is scheduled for November 8-10, 2022.
* **.NET Conf local events**: Jayme asked if DNF could promote the upcoming local events to Foundation members. This is an ongoing discussion and will be revisited in coming meetings.
* **DNF Summit** is scheduled for October 18th. Nicole is already updating the [website](https://www.dnfsummit.org/). If anyone on the Outreach Committee is interested in hosting or producing the event, please contact Nicole.
    * James asked about the success of the July DNF Summit. Nicole reported there were approximately 100 live views throughout the day, and the [recording](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VL0ewZ-0ruo) has been viewed over 2,000 times in the last two months.
* **[Microsoft Reactor](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/reactor/) Events:** James discussed the ongoing events with Microsoft Reactors, noting that there has been a lack of .NET content. He suggested promoting the events and encouraging members to partner with Reactors in their given region to better build connections and efficiently use Microsoft properties. He also shared the event schedule for [.NET MAUI 2022](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/events/learn-events/reactor-NETMAUI-2022/).
    * Nicole asked if Microsoft offices were opening globally. James noted that most are open and suggested members reach out to their local Microsoft contacts. 
    * **ACTION**: James to find a list of Microsoft Marketing contacts for each region that can be shared with interested DNF members.

### AOB
