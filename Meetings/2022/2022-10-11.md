## Agenda:

### .NET Events - Open Discussion
* **DNF Summit** has been postponed to January 2023 as there was limited interest in the October event.
* **.NET Conf** is scheduled for November 8-10, 2022. Jon reported that he has been focused on coordinating .NET Conf, managing the speaker engagement.
* **C# Conference** - Nicole mentioned that there are rumors of a C# Conference. The committee will keep an eye out for any updates.

### Outreach Chair
* As the DNF Board of Directors election has closed and with Shawn Wildermuth stepping down as a Director, the Chair position for the Outreach Committee will be vacant. The committee discussed which of the three new members would be best suited to manage outreach. Jon recommended Joe Guadagno as he has been very active and passionate about Meet-ups. Official officer nominations will occur during the October Board meeting.

**Meeting adjourned at 3:14pm ET**
