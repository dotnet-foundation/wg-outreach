## Agenda
The .NET User Group commit met via YouTube with user group organizers from around the globe (~30 in live attendance) to discuss:

1. Who/what the sub-committee is
2. New updated .NET content
3. State of .NET User Groups
4. Meetup Pro Health Proposal
5. General Discussion

## User Group Health Proposal Plan
Initial plan had overwhelming support from user group organizers to focus on active user groups in the Meetup pro account and to allocate funds for other user group initiatives. The initial plan is as follows:

1. Contact all Meetup Pro user groups that have not met in 2+ Years
2. Timeline: 6 Months to re-activate the group (Find new organizers or schedule meetup (virtual or physical) OR reach out and ask for more time)
3. Notice 1 month before removal to double check
4. User Group is removed from Meetup Pro account
5. Can ALWAYS re-apply for Meetup Pro account

Nicole to follow up on planning of initial emails to user groups ~80.

## User Group Communication Channel
Today, there is no uniform area for user group organizers to meetup and discuss topics. Proposal is to deprecate the Slack & Teams channels as they are not active and create a new Discord for communication of user groups, projects, and more.

James to move forward to bringing this to the Outreach committee.

## Sponsorship & Event Space
Another topic that was raised was around finding sponsorships and event space as user groups open up more. The sub-committee will work to engage with all corporate sponsors to see if there are offers for user group organizers. The creation of a Discord will allow further discussion between organizers. Members from Microsoft will also work to figure out re-opening of Microsoft offices and try to put together a guide on how to engage locally to get meetup space where available.

## Next Townhall
The next townhall will be planned for July 20th 2022 to continue a quarterly sync.
