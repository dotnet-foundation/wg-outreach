## DNF Summit

* It was decided that the summit would be moved to 2024, but a date is not confirmed.
* The DNF Champs promotion and working with membership on that.
* We do not have additional speakers set up, but the three we had for December were available.

## Localization Project around the Foundation Site

* Jorge got access to the webpage.  He will continue to work on that and will document how he does this so that we can solicit others to help.
* The only concern would be graphics.

## Vision/Mission/Goals

* We need to look at streamlining our presences and processes.
* We need to look at the different avenues that we are working on for outreach also, including the possibility of using WhatsApp.

## Action Items

* Joe will set up a meeting this week to discuss outreach to India with Aman.
* Joe will take a look at the graphics on the website.
